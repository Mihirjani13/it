essay, an analytic, interpretative, or critical literary composition usually much shorter and less systematic and formal than a dissertation or thesis and usually dealing with its subject from a limited and often personal point of view.

Some early treatises—such as those of Cicero on the pleasantness of old age or on the art of “divination,” Seneca on anger or clemency, and Plutarch on the passing of oracles—presage to a certain degree the form and tone of the essay, but not until the late 16th century was the flexible and deliberately nonchalant and versatile form of the essay perfected by the French writer Michel de Montaigne. Choosing the name essai to emphasize that his compositions were attempts or endeavours, a groping toward the expression of his personal thoughts and experiences, Montaigne used the essay as a means of self-discovery. His Essais, published in their final form in 1588, are still considered among the finest of their kind. Later writers who most nearly recall the charm of Montaigne include, in England, Robert Burton, though his whimsicality is more erudite, Sir Thomas Browne, and Laurence Sterne, and in France, with more self-consciousness and pose, André Gide and Jean Cocteau.

nonfictional prose: The essay
In modern literatures, the category of nonfictional prose that probably ranks as the most important both in the quantity and in the quality...
At the beginning of the 17th century, social manners, the cultivation of politeness, and the training of an accomplished gentleman became the theme of many essayists. This theme was first exploited by the Italian Baldassare Castiglione in his Il libro del cortegiano (1528; The Book of the Courtier). The influence of the essay and of genres allied to it, such as maxims, portraits, and sketches, proved second to none in molding the behavior of the cultured classes, first in Italy, then in France, and, through French influence, in most of Europe in the 17th century. Among those who pursued this theme was the 17th-century Spanish Jesuit Baltasar Gracián in his essays on the art of worldly wisdom.

Keener political awareness in the 18th century, the age of Enlightenment, made the essay an all-important vehicle for the criticism of society and religion. Because of its flexibility, its brevity, and its potential both for ambiguity and for allusions to current events and conditions, it was an ideal tool for philosophical reformers. The Federalist Papers in America and the tracts of the French Revolutionaries are among the countless examples of attempts during this period to improve the human condition through the essay.

The genre also became the favoured tool of traditionalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who looked to the short, provocative essay as the most potent means of educating the masses. Essays such as Paul Elmer More’s long series of Shelburne Essays (published between 1904 and 1935), T.S. Eliot’s After Strange Gods (1934) and Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948), and others that attempted to reinterpret and redefine culture, established the genre as the most fitting to express the genteel tradition at odds with the democracy of the new world.

Whereas in several countries the essay became the chosen vehicle of literary and social criticism, in other countries the genre became semipolitical, earnestly nationalistic, and often polemical, playful, or bitter. Essayists such as Robert Louis Stevenson and Willa Cather wrote with grace on several lighter subjects, and many writers—including Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos—mastered the essay as a form of literary criticism.

al-Jāḥiẓ, in full Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr ibn Baḥr al-Jāḥiẓ, (born c. 776, Basra, Iraq—died 868/869, Basra), Islamic theologian, intellectual, and litterateur known for his individual and masterful Arabic prose.

His family, possibly of Ethiopian origin, had only modest standing in Basra, but his intellect and wit gained him acceptance in scholarly circles and in society. During the reign of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Maʾmūn, al-Jāḥiẓ moved to the regime’s capital, Baghdad. He did not take a position at court but supported himself, at least in part, with contributions from patrons, often of high rank, in return for the dedications of his books. When the court moved to Sāmarrāʾ, al-Jāḥiẓ journeyed there, but shortly before his death he retired to Basra.

Arabic literature: The concept of adab
…forever known by the nickname al-Jāḥiẓ (“The Man with Boggling Eyes”).
Few of his treatises on theology and politics are extant; some are known only from quotations by other authors. His prose masterpieces, however, are available. Many of these are essays on diverse topics; others are anthologies in which poetry, jokes, and anecdotes, however obscure or daring, have been introduced by al-Jāḥiẓ to illustrate his points. His unfinished Kitāb al-ḥayawān (“Animals”), in seven volumes, is a bestiary drawing on Aristotle and also an anthology of Arabic literature with animal themes to which theological, sociological, and linguistic discussions have been added. Kitāb al-bayān wa al-tabyīn (“Elegance of Expression and Clarity of Exposition”), another long work, treats literary style and the effective use of language. Kitāb al-bukhalāʾ (“Book of Misers”) is a collection of stories about the avaricious. Al-Jāḥiẓ, in effect, provides in his works an entire education in the humanities of his time.

Although noteworthy for his intellectual freedom, al-Jāḥiẓ often supported government policy in his writings. He was, for example, part of the rationalist Muʿtazilite school of theology supported by the caliph al-Maʾmūn and his successor. When Muʿtazilism was abandoned by the caliph al-Mutawakkil, al-Jāḥiẓ remained in favour by writing essays such as Manāqib at-turk (Eng. trans., “Exploits of the Turks,” in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1915), a discussion of the military qualities of the Turkish soldiers, on whom government policy depended.

Uruguayan writer
Alternate titles: Mario Orlando Hamlet Hardy Brenno Beneditti Farugia
   
By Roberto González Echevarría • Edit History
Born: September 14, 1920 Uruguay
Died: May 17, 2009 (aged 88) Montevideo Uruguay
Notable Works: “El cumpleaños de Juan Ángel” “Montevideanos” “The Truce”
Mario Benedetti, (born Sept. 14, 1920, Paso de los Toros, Uruguay—died May 17, 2009, Montevideo), Uruguayan writer who was best known for his short stories.

Benedetti was born to a prosperous family of Italian immigrants. His father was a viniculturist and a chemist. At age four the boy was taken to Montevideo, where he received a superior education at a private school. He was deeply affected by his early experience of the capital city. Benedetti began his literary career by publishing poetry, but he soon turned to the short story and the novel. In these he painted a realistic and critical portrait of the ascendant Uruguayan middle class, to which he belonged. His most accomplished stories appeared in the collection Montevideanos (1959; “Montevideans”), a title that recalls James Joyce’s Dubliners. Like Joyce, Benedetti was enthralled by urban life, and he became the chronicler of the Uruguayan capital’s bourgeoisie, though, unlike Joyce, Benedetti often remained at a descriptive level lacking depth. But his works became best sellers in Uruguay, and by the 1960s his reputation had spread throughout Latin America. His novel La tregua (1960; The Truce) was widely read, as was his allegorical novel El cumpleaños de Juan Angel (1971; Juan Angel’s Birthday). Benedetti had the misfortune of peaking as a writer at the same time as Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and others who brought about what is known as the “boom of the Latin American novel” and with whom he could not compete.
